### Summer Research Symposium

On Wednesday, August 11 at 3pm, we'll have a symposium for all the research that has been going on this summer!
The symposium is an opportunity for summer researchers to share their experiences and progress with each other and with the rest of the department.

#### Program

1. 3:05pm: <b>Eric Chen</b>
   <details><summary><i>Synthesizing Across Time</i></summary>Ever wondered how someone from today would look like in the 1920s? Or how hairstyles have changed between decades? We propose a GAN-based method to synthesize portraits across time.</details>
2. 3:12pm: <b>Ruyu Yan</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Rephotography with AR on Mobile Device</summary>
     A system that enables picture sampling with precise camera pose in the scene, powered by Apple ARKit and a guiding system for pose alignment. It outputs interactive visualizations of images varying in time and space.
   </details>
3. 3:19pm: <b>Devin Smedira</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Scheduling Appointments Online: The Power of Deferred Decision-Making</summary>
     This summer I have been studying the Minimum Peak Appointment Scheduling Problem, an online variant of the bin packing problem. In this problem, an item's position within a bin needs to be decided in an online fashion, but the final placement of items into bins can be performed offline after execution. Previous work described an algorithm with an asymptotic competitive ratio for this problem lower than is possible for traditional bin packing, and my work this summer has resulted in a new algorithm reducing the ratio further.
   </details>
4. 3:26pm: <b>Longxiulin Deng</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Xplainr: Rapid Creation for Explainer Video</summary>
     With the rise of distance learning and virtual lecturing, the need for simple tools for rapidly creating educational content has increased. We present the design and prototype of a tool that makes the best use of existing workflow for the fast creation of educational videos.
   </details>
5. 3:33pm: <b>Yagmur Dulger</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Attempts at Modeling Diffusion of Innovations in Social Networks</summary>
     What set of individuals in a society should we advertise a new technology to (with limited budget), so that we maximize the number of people who end up adopting it? Taking as a starting point Eva Tardos's paper "Maximizing Spread of Influence in Social Networks", I spent the summer working on extending the model described in the paper, trying to approximate an answer to this NP-Hard problem.
   </details>
6. 3:40pm: <b>Aliva Das</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Automated Error Analysis for Template Filling</summary>
     The project involves creating a system that automatically searches for a predefined set of errors among model generated templates and their respective filled slots as compared to the gold templates. This project hopes to supplement traditional, manual qualitative analysis of the models' output and attempts to offer details about the model performance which can be hard to interpret using common evaluation metrics such as F1.
   </details>
7. 3:47pm: <b>Sanjit Basker</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Motivating RCCA Encryption</summary>
     At the beginnings of cryptography, various methods of justifying security were proposed. I'll motivate and introduce the definition of an RCCA-secure encryption scheme, which was the main topic of my project.
   </details>
8. 3:54pm: <b>Blake Gallay</b>
   <details>
     <summary>Tree Codes</summary>
     While the problem of how to send individual messages over noisy channels has been studied for decades, the interactive communication setting has been resilient to our best efforts. A peculiar combinatorial object called a tree code is the key to provably good interactive protocols, but no constructions of these objects are known. The problem of finding such a construction is what I worked on this summer.

#### Logistics and Advice

All undergraduates working on computer science research this summer are invited to present.
The event will by "hybrid," so you can participate either in Ithaca or on Zoom.
Presenters will give a lightning talk and take questions from the audience.

**Sign up to give a lightning talk.**
Please [fill out this form][form] by **Friday, August 6** to register to give a lightning talk.

[form]: https://forms.gle/yVqdHy3SRw6qK9dy9

**Lightning talk guidelines.**
Presenters will each give a 5-minute lightning talk.
We recommend this format:

* 1 minute: Motivation and background. Introduce the general area and tell the audience why they should care. If you work on algorithms for fast genome sequence alignment, for example, tell us about biologists who are bored of waiting for their alignment jobs to complete. Get creative here---this is your chance to get your audience to care!
* 1 minute: Project introduction. Tell us about the project you contributed to. This might be broader than just what you contributed to. For example, if your work was on extending a programming language that other people in the lab had previously designed, tell us about the language and its goals.
* 2 minutes: What you did. What was your focus for the summer, and what did you concretely do all day? If you have results or outcomes, tell us about those. If your work was more diffuse than that, just tell us more narratively what kept you busy all summer.
* 1 minute: Reflection. While the rest of the talk is about the research, this last section is about *you* and your reactions to it. What did you enjoy about the research? What was challenging? Was this your first time---and if not, how did it differ from previous research experiences you've had? Did you learn anything? What advice would you give to someone considering summer CS research in the future? This section is totally open-ended; tell us anything you like about your experience this summer.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

* Please practice your talk a few times before the symposium. We'll be strict with the timing, so make sure you can get the whole thing done in 5 minutes flat.
* Your work is probably collaborative with your mentors and other researchers. That's OK---you can summarize what the entire team has been up to. But somewhere in the talk, try to emphasize which pieces, if any, you think you can claim as your own.
* Your audience will have varied CS backgrounds, so they won't be an expert on the particular sub-area of your research. Try to explain enough so that someone who has only taken "standard" undergraduate CS classes, not specialized upper-division ones, can understand.
