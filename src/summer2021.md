# CSURP Talk Series

We're running a series of enrichment talks for undergraduate researchers who are doing research in the Bowers College this summer.
It happens on **Wednesdays at 3pm** in **Gates 310**.
You can also join via Zoomâ€”look in your email or ask [Adrian](mailto:asampson@cs.cornell.edu) for a link.

### Summer Research Symposium

On Wednesday, August 11 at 3pm, we'll have a symposium for all the research that has been going on this summer!
The symposium is an opportunity for summer researchers to share their experiences and progress with each other and with the rest of the department.

All undergraduates working on computer science research this summer are invited to present.
The event will by "hybrid," so you can participate either in Ithaca or on Zoom.
Presenters will give a lightning talk and take questions from the audience.

**Lightning talk guidelines.**
Presenters will each give a 5-minute lightning talk.
We recommend this format:

* 1 minute: Motivation and background. Introduce the general area and tell the audience why they should care. If you work on algorithms for fast genome sequence alignment, for example, tell us about biologists who are bored of waiting for their alignment jobs to complete. Get creative here---this is your chance to get your audience to care!
* 1 minute: Project introduction. Tell us about the project you contributed to. This might be broader than just what you contributed to. For example, if your work was on extending a programming language that other people in the lab had previously designed, tell us about the language and its goals.
* 2 minutes: What you did. What was your focus for the summer, and what did you concretely do all day? If you have results or outcomes, tell us about those. If your work was more diffuse than that, just tell us more narratively what kept you busy all summer.
* 1 minute: Reflection. While the rest of the talk is about the research, this last section is about *you* and your reactions to it. What did you enjoy about the research? What was challenging? Was this your first time---and if not, how did it differ from previous research experiences you've had? Did you learn anything? What advice would you give to someone considering summer CS research in the future? This section is totally open-ended; tell us anything you like about your experience this summer.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

* Please practice your talk a few times before the symposium. We'll be strict with the timing, so make sure you can get the whole thing done in 5 minutes flat.
* Your work is probably collaborative with your mentors and other researchers. That's OK---you can summarize what the entire team has been up to. But somewhere in the talk, try to emphasize which pieces, if any, you think you can claim as your own.
* Your audience will have varied CS backgrounds, so they won't be an expert on the particular sub-area of your research. Try to explain enough so that someone who has only taken "standard" undergraduate CS classes, not specialized upper-division ones, can understand.
