Doing research as an undergraduate can be fun, challenging, and rewarding---and it can help you decide whether you're interested in grad school.
[Our research group][capra] includes many talented undergraduate researchers, and we often look for new collaborators.
Here are some things you should know about research in our group:

* We are mainly interested in programming languages, computer architecture, and their intersection. So if either of those topics is exciting to you, we might be a good fit.
* You should also consider contacting other labs at Cornell! Try [the PL faculty in CS][pl] or [the architecture faculty in CSL][csl].
* There is no strict "minimum experience" required to get involved in research, but it really helps to have some advanced coursework done. We recommend that you have finished [CS 3110][], [CS 3410][], or similar courses in ECE.
* You do not need to have specific research directions in mind. The way this usually works is that new researchers join an ongoing project and "own" a specific piece of work that they contribute to an overall whole.
* You also do not need to be planning on going to grad school. Research can be useful even if it doesn't lead to a career in research. However, trying out research is the best way to decide whether you might be interested in grad school.
* Most undergrad researchers get involved during the semester, when you will need to balance research commitments with coursework. However, it's also possible to do research over the summer, when you treat it more like a full-time job.
* You can do research for credit, by registering for [CS 4999][], or for money, in which case we'll hire you on an hourly basis.

We use GitHub issues to communicate with Cornell students interested in joining our research group.
