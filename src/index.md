# The 2017 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack

<img src="waxlogo500.jpg" style="max-width: 120px;" class="illus">

Welcome to the 2017 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack (WAX)! WAX is a venue for research focusing on computing with unreliability and inexactness.
It will be co-located with [ASPLOS 2017][].

See the [Call for Participation][cfp].
You can submit peer-reviewed position papers, lightning talks, and discussion topics---or, we hope, all three.
